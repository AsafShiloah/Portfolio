# Asaf Shiloah's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm Asaf, an aspiring software developer with a growing interest in machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms. This portfolio highlights my journey, projects, and learning experiences as I advance in the field of technology.

## About Me

I am a student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem studying dual major in Neuroscience and Computer science. I am currently building my expertise in software development and machine learning through hands-on projects and participation in hackathon. My goal is to develop robust software solutions for real world problems.

## Projects

### LLM's bias manipulation project

**Description**: This project investigates acquiescence bias in AI language models, focusing on their tendency to agree or disagree regardless of statement content. Techniques like the Chi-squared test and the "Chain of Thoughts" method were used to analyze and attempt to mitigate biases in models such as GPT-2, Gemma 2b, and Phi 2.

**Technologies Used**: Python, PyTorch, Transformers, SciPy, Jupyter

**Key Findings**:
- GPT-2 showed a strong disagreement bias.
- Gemma 2b exhibited a more balanced but still biased tendency.
- Phi 2 consistently displayed a strong acquiescence bias.

**De-Biasing Efforts**: Successfully de-biased Gemma 2b using the "Chain of Thoughts" method, though other models showed mixed responses to the interventions.

**Lessons Learned**: Enhanced understanding of neural behavior in language models and gained practical experience in applying statistical methods for bias detection and mitigation.

### Simulation of Multi-Agent Systems (Research Project)

#### Overview
For my personal learning project, I am simulating a multi-agent system using actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm. This project is a theoretical and practical exercise to understand the dynamics of multi-agent interactions as part of a research from the computational cognition lab I work at.

#### Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

#### Key Learning Points
- Understanding the principles of reinforcement learning and its applications to multi-agent environments.
- Developing a simple model to explore how agents learn and make decisions in a controlled setting.

**Note**: Details and specific results of this research are confidential due to privacy concerns associated with the academic study.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript, C/C++
- **Frameworks/Tools**: TensorFlow, Git
- **Areas of Interest**: Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Software Development, Data Science, Computational Cognition and Phsychology
